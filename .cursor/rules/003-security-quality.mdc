# Security and Quality Gate Requirements

- **Static analysis & vulnerability scanning**: For every repository, run language‑appropriate security scanners:
  - **Python** – `pip-audit`, `bandit`.
  - **Node** – `npm audit`, `npx synk`.
  - **Go** – `govulncheck`.
  - **Java** – `maven dependency:analyze`, `owasp-dependency-check`.
- **Dependency updates**: Use dependency update tools (e.g., Dependabot or Renovate) to keep dependencies up to date. The security subagent must review updates and ensure no critical vulnerabilities remain before release.
- **Secrets detection**: Scan the repository for secrets or API keys before pushing.
- **Release checklist**:
  1. Ensure all tests and quality gates are green.
  2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with user‑visible changes.
  3. Bump version numbers according to semantic versioning.
  4. Tag the release in version control.
  5. Ensure documentation and API reference are up to date.
  6. Verify that deployment configuration (e.g., Kubernetes manifests) matches the new version.

- **Escalation policy**: If critical vulnerabilities are found, block the release and inform the user with remediation steps.
