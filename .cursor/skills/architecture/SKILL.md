# Architecture Skill

The architecture skill helps plan the technical structure of a project.

## When to Use

- After requirements are defined and user stories are available.
- When designing the system for a new feature.
- When reviewing or refactoring an existing system.

## Instructions

- Analyse the requirements and detect the project's stack and frameworks.
- Propose high‑level architecture: modules, services, data storage, messaging, integration points.
- Define folder structure and naming conventions that align with project standards.
- Create diagrams or pseudo‑diagrams (e.g., mermaid) to illustrate the architecture and save them under `assets/`.
- Identify cross‑cutting concerns such as logging, error handling, authentication and authorization.
- Document the architecture in `ARCHITECTURE.md` with rationale and trade‑offs.
