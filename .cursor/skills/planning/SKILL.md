# Planning Skill

The planning skill guides the agent through initial requirements gathering and project scoping.

## When to Use

## Instructions

- Use the ask questions tool to gather missing details from the user.
- Translate high‑level requirements into clear user stories with acceptance criteria.
- Prioritize stories based on user impact and dependencies.
- Produce a `PLAN.md` document summarising the scope, constraints, milestones and deliverables.
- Check for conflicts or unclear requirements and request clarification before proceeding.
