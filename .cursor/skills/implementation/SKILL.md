# Implementation Skill

The implementation skill guides code writing and local validation.

## When to Use

- When starting to code a user story or task.
- When refactoring or adding new functionality.
- When writing tests for existing functionality.

## Instructions

- Follow the architecture and file structure defined earlier.
- Write tests first when appropriate (test‑driven development).
- Implement code in small, logical commits.
- Use the tooling matrix to run linters, formatters and type checkers frequently.
- Write descriptive commit messages and update documentation as needed.
- Respect coding conventions and patterns specific to the project.
- Ask questions if you encounter ambiguous requirements.
