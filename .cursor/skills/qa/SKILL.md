# Quality Assurance Skill

The QA skill ensures that code meets quality standards before merging or releasing.

## When to Use

- After implementing a feature or fixing a bug.
- When preparing a pull request.
- During continuous integration.

## Instructions

- Run the full test suite using the appropriate test runner (e.g., `pytest`, `npm test`).
- Measure test coverage and ensure it meets the project's threshold.
- Run all linters, formatters and type checkers.
- Summarize test results, coverage reports and lint warnings.
- Provide actionable feedback or open issues for problems discovered.
- Verify that documentation and examples compile without errors.
